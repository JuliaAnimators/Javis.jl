    morph_to(to_func::Function; object=:stroke)

A closure for the [`_morph`](@ref) function.
This makes it easier to write the function inside an `Object`.

Currently morphing is quite simple and only works for basic shapes.
It especially does not work with functions which produce more than one polygon
or which produce filled polygons.
Blending between fills of polygons is definitely coming at a later stage.

**Important:** The functions itself should not draw the polygon
i.e. use `circle(Point(100,100), 50)` instead of `circle(Point(100,100), 50, :stroke)`

# Arguments
- `to_func::Function`: Same as `from_func` but it defines the "result" polygon,
                       which will be displayed at the end of the Object

# Keywords
- `object::Symbol` defines whether the object has a fill or just a stroke. Defaults to stroke.

# Example

This creates a star that morphs into a circle and back.

```
astar(args...) = star(O, 50)
acirc(args...) = circle(Point(100,100), 50)

video = Video(500, 500)
back = Background(1:20, ground)
star_obj = Object(1:10, astar)
act!(star_obj, Action(linear(), morph_to(acirc)))
circle_obj = Object(11:20, acirc)
act!(circle_obj, Action(:same, morph_to(astar)))
```
