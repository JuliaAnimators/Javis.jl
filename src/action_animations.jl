    appear(s::Symbol)

Appear can be used inside an [`Action`](@ref) to make an [`Object`](@ref) or an entire [`Object`](@ref) (including it's objects) to appear.

# Example
```julia
house = Object(101:200, (args...)->house_of_nicholas())
act!(house, Action(1:20, appear(:fade)))
act!(house, Action(81:100, disappear(:fade)))
```
In this case the `house_of_nicholas` will fade in during the first 20 frames
of the [`Object`](@ref) so `101-120`.

# Arguments
- `s::Symbol`: the symbol defines the animation of appearance
    The only symbols that are currently supported are:
    - `:fade_line_width` which increases the line width up to the default value
       or the value specified by [`setline`](@ref)
    - `:fade` which increases the opcacity up to the default value
       or the value specified by [`setopacity`](@ref)
    - `:scale` which increases the scale up to the default value `1`
       or the value specified by [`scale`](@ref)
    - `:draw_text` which only works for [`text`](@ref) and lets it appear from left to right.

For a layer only `appear(:fade)` is supported

"""
    translate()

Translate an [`Object`](@ref) or a [`Layer`](@ref) using an [`Action`](@ref) and an Animation defined
with Animations.jl.

If you're used to working with Animations.jl this should feel quite natural.
Instead of defining each movement in its own action it's possible to define it in one
by using an Animation.

# Example
```julia
using Javis, Animations

function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

video = Video(500, 500)
circle_anim = Animation(
    [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0], # must go from 0 to 1
    # the circle will move from the origin to `Point(150, 0)` then `Point(150, 150)`
    # and back to the origin `O`.
    [O, Point(150, 0), Point(150, 150), O],
    [sineio(), polyin(5), expin(8)],
)

Background(1:150, ground)
obj = Object((args...)->circle(O, 25, :fill))
act!(obj, Action(1:150, circle_anim, translate()))

render(video)
```

Here `circle_anim` defines the movement of the circle. The most important part is that the
time in animations has to be from `0.0` to `1.0`.

This notation uses the Animations.jl library very explicitly. It's also possible to do the
same with:

```julia
obj = Object((args...)->circle(O, 25, :fill))
act!(obj, Action(1:50, sineio(), anim_translate(150, 0)))
act!(obj, Action(51:100, polyin(2), anim_translate(0, 150)))
act!(obj, Action(101:150, expin(8), anim_translate(-150, -150)))
```

which uses the `Action` syntax three times and only uses easing functions instead of
specifying the `Animation` directly. Have a look at [`anim_translate`](@ref) for details.

    rotate()

Rotate an [`Object`](@ref) or a [`Layer`](@ref) using an [`Action`](@ref) and an Animation defined
