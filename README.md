**Javis:** **J**ulia **A**nimations and **Vis**ualizations

## Introduction 

`Javis` makes generating simple animations a breeze!

## Installation

To install `Javis` into your Julia installation, type into your Julia REPL the following:

```
julia> ] add Javis
```

That's all there is to it! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Optional Dependency

`Javis` supports `LaTeX` and currently we need this node dependency for it. We are looking forward to the time when everything can be handled by Julia.

```
npm install -g mathjax-node-cli
```

If you don't need `LaTeX`, there is no reason to install this :wink:

## State of development

`Javis.jl` is currently under heavy development but we wanted to bring you a first version after we received over 30 stars. It makes it easier to try out `Javis.jl` for you and we are looking forward to bug reports and issue requests. More the latter, but we expect things to fail!

### Current state

#### v0.1.0

`Javis` currently supports very simple animations with:
- `LaTeX` support
- Transformations
- Subactions
- Drawing grid lines
- A tiny bit of morphing a shape into another 

## Future goals

We have a list of issues for v0.2.0 and beyond which contain things like:
- Animating transposing a matrix
- More morphing
- Combine actions into layers/collections
- Polar coordinates
- Vectors
- ...

Make sure to add a feature request if you think we miss something fundamental or something that would be nice to have.

## Acknowledgements

We want to thank a couple of people who helped make this possible.
