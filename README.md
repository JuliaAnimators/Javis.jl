## Design Philosophy

Although `Javis.jl` is constantly being improved and made better, our design philosophy remains largely the same with only few changes happening to it.
We use Object-Action paradigm for creating visualizations.
Furthermore, details on our philosophy can be found here: [Design Mission and Philosophy](https://wikunia.github.io/Javis.jl/stable/mission/)

## Installation

To install `Javis` into your Julia installation, type into your Julia REPL the following:

```
julia> ] add Javis
```

That's all there is to it! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Optional Dependency

`Javis` supports `LaTeX` and currently we need this node dependency for it. We are looking forward to the time when everything can be handled by Julia.

```
npm install -g mathjax-node-cli
```

If you don't need `LaTeX`, there is no reason to install this :wink:
