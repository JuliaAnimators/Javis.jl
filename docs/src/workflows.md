# Workflows for `Javis` Animation Development

`Javis` provides an easy way to create performant visualizations.
However, sometimes building these animations can be a difficult process with having to keep track of one's code, particular frames, and previewing your graphic.
This section is dedicated to workflows one can use for making `Javis` animations.

## Previewing Animations Using the Javis Live Viewer

Supported Platforms: Windows*, OSX, Linux

> NOTE: Windows users may experience a slow-down with the Javis Live Viewer. 
> This is because the viewer is built on top of GTK which is not immensely performant on Windows machines.
> If the viewer is does not perform well on Windows for you, we encourage you to try out one of the other workflows.
